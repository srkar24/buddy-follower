## Final Project
Implemented buddy follower using two robots, have one robot follow another with precision to a marked location.
The lead robot will use a controller to drive in a path with numerous turns to a marked location. 
The follower robot will use three Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F Analog Distance Sensors (left, center, right) and another controller will be used to develop a following algorithm for this robot.

The buddy follower interfaces with the following:
    Three Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F Analog Distance Sensors (10 - 80 cm)
    Pololu Gearmotor with Encoder
